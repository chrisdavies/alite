## Usage

Create a new instance of Alite:

```javascript
var alite = Alite();
```

### Ajax methods

There are several methods, each with an identical signature: put, post, patch, get, delete, and ajax.

Each of these takes a single argument, which is an object of the following shape:

```js
{
  // Required: the URL to send/receive from
  url: '/api/foo/bar',

  // Optional: the object to send as JSON, or raw if the raw flag is set
  data: { foo: 'bar' },

  // Optional: A flag indicating whether or not this is a raw request
  // (by default, this is false, and data is turned into a JSON string)
  raw: false,

  // Optional: an object containing the HTTP headers to set
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa(username + ':' + password)
  },

  // Optional: a function to be called before the AJAX request is sent
  ajaxStart: function (xhr) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Some examples follow:

```js
alite.get({ url: '/api/foo' });

alite.delete({ url: '/api/foo/1' });

alite.patch({
  url: '/api/foo/1',
  data: { name: 'Joe', age: 32 }
});

alite.put({
  url: '/api/foo/1',
  data: { name: 'Joe', age: 32 }
});

alite.post({
  url: '/api/foo',
  data: { name: 'Joe', age: 32 }
});

alite.ajax({
  url: '/api/foo',
  data: { name: 'Joe', age: 32 },
  method: 'POST'
});
```

### Promises

Each of these methods returns a promise, and so is generally called like this:

```javascript
alite.get({ url: 'https://api.github.com/users' })
  .then(function (result) {
    // Result is the deserialized JSON object/array that came back from the server
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    // err is the deserialzed JSON object/array that was returned from the server
    console.log(err);
  });
```

The promise object has a non-standard property attached to it: `xhr` which can be accessed
inside then/catch via `this.xhr`.

```js
alite.delete('users/24')
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // The JSON object received
    console.log(this.xhr.getResponseHeader('Server')); // Get the XHR object from the promise
  });
```

### Example file upload

The following code is taken from a production app that uploads files to S3:

```js
// File is a file object obtained from an input[type=file] element
// presigned is an object representing AWS S3 presigned URL info...
function upload(file, presigned) {
  var alite = Alite();
  var data = new FormData();

  data.append('utf8', 'âœ“');
  data.append('Content-Type', file.type);
  data.append('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename = "${filename}"');
  data.append('key', presigned.fullKey);
  data.append('AWSAccessKeyId', presigned.awsAccessKeyId);
  data.append('acl', presigned.acl);
  data.append('policy', presigned.policy);
  data.append('signature', presigned.signature);
  data.append('file', file);

  return alite.post({
    url: presigned.url,
    data: data,
    raw: true, // This isn't going to be a JSON request
    ajaxStart: function (xhr) {
      xhr.upload.addEventListener('progress', function (e) {
        updateProgressBar(Math.ceil((e.loaded / e.total) * 100));
      }, false);
    }
  });
}
```

### Global AJAX notifications: ajaxStart/ajaxStop

The Alite object has two properties which you can set in order to receive notifications
when an ajax request starts or completes:

```js
var alite = Alite();

// xhr is the raw XMLHttpRequest object
// opts is the argument that was passed to the Alite ajax method
//   that triggered this request.
alite.ajaxStart = function (xhr, opts) {
  // Pass the CSRF token along with the request...
  xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').getAttribute('content'));
};

alite.ajaxStop = function (xhr, opts) {
  // This runs whenever an AJAX request has completed (success or error)
};
```

## Assumptions

If `raw` is not specified or is false, data is sent as JSON and is automatically serialized for you.

Alite requires Promise support. In older browsers, Promises can be shimmed
easily enough with something like [Plite](https://github.com/chrisdavies/plite).

Alite currently has a naive method of detecting if a response is JSON... If it
starts with `{` or `[`, then the response is considered JSON.

## Installing
